        <h1>2021 Microsoft Exchange Server data breach</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
        <p>A global wave of cyberattacks and data breaches began in January 2021 after four zero-day exploits were
            discovered in
            on-premises Microsoft Exchange Servers, giving attackers full access to user emails and passwords on
            affected
            servers, administrator privileges on the server itself, and access to connected devices on the same network.
            Attackers typically install a backdoor that allows the attacker full access to impacted servers even if the
            server
            is later updated to no longer be vulnerable to the original exploits. As of 9 March 2021, it was estimated
            that
            250,000 servers fell victim to the attacks, including servers belonging to around 30,000 organisations in
            the United
            States, 7,000 servers in the United Kingdom,[8] as well as the European Banking Authority and the Norwegian
            Parliament.[9][10][11]
            <br>
            Small and medium businesses, local institutions, and local governments are known to be the primary victims
            of the
            attack, as they often have smaller budgets to secure against cyber threats and typically outsource IT
            services to
            local providers that do not have the expertise to deal with cyber attacks.[12]
            <br>
            On 12 March 2021, Microsoft announced the discovery of "a new family of ransomware" being deployed to
            servers
            initially infected, encrypting all files, making the server inoperable and demanding payment to reverse the
            damage.[13]

        <p>Microsoft Exchange is considered a high-value target for hackers looking to penetrate business networks as it
            is
            email server software, and, according to Microsoft, it provides "a unique environment that could allow
            attackers to
            perform various tasks using the same built-in tools or scripts that admins use for maintenance."[14] In the
            past,
            Microsoft Exchange has been attack`ed by multiple nation-state groups.[15][16]</p>

        <p>On 5 January 2021, security testing company DEVCORE made the earliest known report of the vulnerability to
            Microsoft, which Microsoft verified on 8 January.[17] The first breach of a Microsoft Exchange Server
            instance was
            observed by cybersecurity company Volexity on 6 January 2021.[1] According to Microsoft, the attack was
            initially
            perpetrated by the Hafnium hacking group, which Microsoft has alleged to be "state-sponsored and operating
            out of
            China".[5][18][6] By the end of January, cybersecurity company Volexity had observed a breach allowing
            attackers to
            spy on two of their customers, and alerted Microsoft to the vulnerability. After Microsoft was alerted of
            the
            breach, Volexity noted the hackers became less stealthy in anticipation of a patch.[18]</p>

        <p>Another cybersecurity company, ESET, wrote on 2 March that they were observing multiple attackers besides
            Hafnium
            exploiting the vulnerabilities.[4] Wired reported on 10 March that now that the vulnerability had been
            patched, many
            more attackers were going to reverse engineer the fix to exploit still-vulnerable servers. Analysts at two
            security
            firms reported they had begun to see evidence that attackers were preparing to run cryptomining software on
            the
            servers.[19]</p>

        <p>On 10 March, security researcher Nguyen Jang posted proof-of-concept code to Microsoft-owned Github on how
            the
            exploit works, totalling 169 lines of code; the program was intentionally written with errors so that while
            security
            researchers could understand how the exploit works, malicious actors would not be able to use the code to
            access
            servers. Later that day, Github removed the code as it "contains proof of concept code for a recently
            disclosed
            vulnerability that is being actively exploited".[20][21]</p>

        <p>The attacks came shortly after the 2020 United States federal government data breach, which also saw the
            compromising of Microsoft's Outlook web app and supply chain. Microsoft said there was no connection between
            the two
            incidents.</p>

        <h2 id="imp">Impact</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hackers have exploited the vulnerabilities to spy on a wide range of targets, affecting an estimated 250,000
            servers.[11][33] Microsoft's Tom Burt wrote in a blog post that targets had included disease researchers,
            law
            offices, universities, defence contractors, non-governmental organisations and think tanks.[34][9][35] The
            attack
            was discovered after attackers were discovered downloading all emails belonging to specific users on
            separate
            corporate Exchange servers.[26] An undisclosed Washington think tank reported attackers sending convincing
            emails to
            contacts in a social engineering attack that encouraged recipients to click on a link.[35] On 11 March 2021,
            Norway's parliament, the Storting, reported being a victim of the hack, stating that "data has been
            extracted."[36]</p>

        <p>Small and medium businesses, and local institutions such as schools and local governments, are known to be
            the
            primary victims of the attack, as they typically operate under smaller budgets to deal with cyber threats
            and
            outsource their IT to local firms without expertise in cybersecurity. Rural victims are noted to be "largely
            on
            their own", as they are typically without access to IT service providers.[12] On 11 March 2021, Check Point
            Research
            revealed that in the prior 24 hours "the number exploitation attempts on organizations it tracks tripled
            every two
            to three hours."[37][38]</p>

        <p>The European Banking Authority also reported that it had been targeted in the attack,[10] later stating in a
            press
            release that the scope of impact on its systems was "limited" and that "the confidentiality of the EBA
            systems and
            data has not been compromised".[39]</p>

        <p>Security company ESET identified "at least 10" advanced persistent threat groups compromising IT,
            cybersecurity,
            energy, software development, public utility, real estate, telecommunications and engineering businesses, as
            well as
            Middle Eastern and South American governmental agencies. One APT group was identified deploying PowerShell
            downloaders, using affected servers for cryptocurrency mining.[28] Cybereason CEO Lior Div noted that APT
            group
            Hafnium "targeted small and medium-sized enterprises ... The assault against Microsoft Exchange is 1,000
            times more
            devastating than the SolarWinds attack."[40]</p>

        <p>On 12 March 2021, Microsoft Security Intelligence announced "a new family of ransomware" called DearCry being
            deployed to the servers that had been initially infected, encrypting device contents, making servers
            unusable and
            demanding payment to recover files.[13] Microsoft stated: "There is no guarantee that paying the ransom will
            give
            you access to your files."[41]</p>
        <h2 id="met">Methodology</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Hackers took advantage of four separate zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise Microsoft Exchange servers'
            Outlook
            Web Access (OWA),[2] giving them access to victims' entire servers and networks as well as to emails and
            calendar
            invitations,[4] only at first requiring the address of the server, which can be directly targeted or
            obtained by
            mass-scanning for vulnerable servers, and any valid email and password combination, which is typically
            obtained
            through credential stuffing. After successfully logging in as any user, attackers can then take the ASP.NET
            session
            ID and the ViewStateGenerator directly from the server, and by passing both back to the server, an OWA SSRF
            vulnerability can be exploited, allowing attackers to connect to the server remotely and impersonate
            administrators,
            gaining their privileges.[23] The attackers then upload code to the server that automatically runs with
            administrator privileges and installs a web shell, providing a backdoor to the compromised server,[24] which
            gives
            hackers continued access to the server as long as both the web shell remains active and the Exchange server
            remains
            on.[25]</p>

        <p>Through the web shell installed by attackers, commands can be run remotely. Among the actions observed are
            the
            downloading of all emails from servers, downloading the passwords and email addresses of users as Microsoft
            Exchange
            stores these unencrypted in memory, adding users, adding further backdoors to affected systems, accessing
            other
            systems in the network that are unsusceptible to the original exploit, and installing ransomware.[26][7] As
            patching
            the Exchange server against the exploit does not retroactively remove installed backdoors, attackers
            continue to
            have access to the server until the web shell, other backdoors and user accounts added by attackers are
            removed.[27]</p>

        <p>As of 12 March 2021, there are at least ten distinct groups exploiting the vulnerabilities, including
            Hafnium. Each
            is using different styles and different procedures.[28][25] On 27 and 28 February 2021, there was an
            automated
            attack, and on 2 and 3 March 2021, attackers used a script to return to the addresses to drop a web shell to
            enable
            them to return later.[25] Referring to the week ending 7 March, CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch
            stated:
            "Every possible victim that hadn't patched by mid-to-end of last week has already been hit by at least one
            or
            several actors..[29] After the patch was announced, the tactics changed when using the same chain of
            vulnerabilities.[25][30]</p>

        <p>Microsoft Exchange Server versions of 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019 were confirmed to be susceptible, although
            vulnerable editions are yet to be fully determined.[31] Cloud-based services Exchange Online and Office 365
            are not
            affected.[32]</p>

        <h2 id="resp">Responses</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>On 2 March 2021, the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) publicly posted an out-of-band Common
            Vulnerabilities
            and Exposures (CVE) release, urging its clients to patch their Exchange servers to address a number of
            critical
            vulnerabilities.[3]</p>

        <p>On 3 March 2021, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an emergency
            directive
            forcing government networks to update to a patched version of Exchange. On 8 March, CISA tweeted what NBC
            News
            described as an "unusually candid message" urging "ALL organizations across ALL sectors" to address the
            vulnerabilities.[42][43]</p>

        <p>Other official bodies expressing concerns included the White House, Norway's National Security Authority and
            the
            Czech Republic's Office for Cyber and Information Security.[44][45] On 7 March 2021, CNN reported that the
            Biden
            administration was expected to form a task force to address the breach;[46] the Biden administration has
            invited
            private-sector organizations to participate in the task force and will provide them with classified
            information
            as
            deemed necessary. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan stated that the U.S. is not yet in a position
            to
            attribute blame for the attacks.[37]</p>

        <p>The Chinese government has said it was not involved with the attacks, describing Microsoft's allegations of
            involvement as "groundless"</p>
